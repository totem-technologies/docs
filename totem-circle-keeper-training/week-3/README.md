# Week 3

### Values and Guidelines

This module will cover the final two constituent elements: Values/Guidelines, and Consensus. Establishing values and guidelines may prove frustrating and time-consuming. But, it is essential for group cohesion and must not be diluted in any Circle Process that has a group and is ongoing (e.g. if it is a one-off circle for only a few or two people then you may choose to skip this step. But, if you choose to omit values, guidelines and/or consensus then be vigilant to make sure that the container is sufficient.

At the heart of these is the foundation for building a solid group container. If the container is established with shared intention (i.e. purpose) and patience then, as Kay taught us, it may feel safe enough to allow each participant to be brave. This may allow each individual access to parts of themselves that they may never have accessed before. Thus safety is essential for deep work leading to transformation.

#### The importance of Safety&#x20;

We are programmed to determine our level of safety, threat, or danger. Any harmful experiences endured in the past can leave us feeling a lack of control and difficulty creating or maintaining boundaries. As keepers, we do our best to create a container with clear, powerful boundaries. Then, we hold space (we will discuss this concept in depth later) so that personal truth might be spoken out loud to the rest of the group, usually strangers.

Circle provides an opportunity to change the experience of lacking control and boundaries both within ourselves and within the community. Guidelines take into account the safety needs of an individual by establishing consensus on a list of aspirations that meet the needs of each individual participant.

There are many factors that contribute to a participant's sense of safety. Some of those may include the environment, privacy, informed consent, connection, support, and compassion. Although judgment is hardwired into us, we can choose to notice judgment when it arises with vigilance. Then, we can remind ourselves that we alone own this judgment and it is not actually related to the object (i.e. our self, others, the environment).

#### The Circle Keeper’s Role in Creating Safety

Circle Keepers play a vital role in creating an experience of safety for group members. First, Circle Keepers can establish safety by being mindful of the environment of the Circle. Although this may be more applicable to in-person Circles, the environment should also be considered in the case of online circles. Make every attempt to eliminate any distractions that might arise (noise, connectivity, etc.), and pay careful attention to any potential barriers to privacy.

Second, Circle Keepers can create safety by modeling healthy communication boundaries and effective, vulnerable sharing. As a Circle Keeper, you _share_ to be _known_ in such a way that your own honesty and truth can be witnessed by the group. When you do, participants begin to see the depth and weight with which they are being invited to share. In this way (through modeling), you _give permission_ for others to step into the experience of speaking their own truth and wisdom.&#x20;

As keepers, we make it a practice to be aware of our own internal experience of safety so that we can sense the seen and unseen dynamics of safety that are playing out within a group. We believe it essential for Totem Keepers to commit to self-awareness and internal alignment. Recognizing our own triggers, reactions, and projections allows Circle to unfold naturally. This awareness curbs any unconscious influence from our own internal fears, limiting beliefs, or projections. As Keepers, we practice attuning our awareness of our inner landscape to increase our capacity to hold space. By holding space, we intend to give participants the choice to confront shadow, trauma and hurt.

### The process of Establishing Values and Guidelines

#### Values

[Watch this video about values, guidelines and creating a powerful container](https://www.veed.io/view/e217a5db-9ea7-435a-b6ed-cf92f83a50d2?panel=share)

Values are the first step in the process of identifying the group “norms” or “expectations” that we refer to as _guidelines_. Values are identified in every ongoing group and represent the internal working model of the group process. We elicit this information by asking participants to **write** down and then respond to the following prompt:&#x20;

_What are two values that describe you at your best._&#x20;

We share and witness each other's two chosen values. We recognize that that list of values merge to form one container. The foundational structure is the unification of these values. Our individual values become the collective’s values _when it is at its best_.

#### Guidelines

_Watch these two videos about creating guidelines_ [_here_ ](https://www.veed.io/view/fa78e5fc-acc2-440a-ba07-85da573bcd8c?panel=share)_and_ [_here_](https://www.veed.io/view/3e7959cb-093e-443c-9b11-5ee45e7bd5e9?panel=share)__

Guidelines are the culmination of expressed needs that are born out of the process of identifying, refining, understanding, and eventually agreeing upon what is needed within the group to allow each person to show up as their best self. &#x20;

In this process, we are guided by the understanding that the _experience_ of explaining, fine-tuning, and expressing the heart of what someone needs for safety is as valuable as the guideline itself. This is a secret that we do not share with people but instead allow them to realize on their own.  This phase of container building is an exhaustive process. It is energetically powerful, is a fundamental part of creating genuine safety, and must not be rushed. We elicit the needs of the group by asking the following prompt:

_What do you need from this group so that you can show up as your best self?_

During this phase, the Circle Keeper takes notes of the language of each individual to effectively record the guideline/need that is being expressed. The Keeper must be careful not to question, judge, or relate to the content of what is being expressed, but instead, serve as a scribe to record the information as accurately as possible.&#x20;

#### Consensus&#x20;

Once the needs of the group have been expressed, the Circle continues to discuss these needs more deeply in a process called Consensus Decision Making. During this phase, members are encouraged to carefully consider the guidelines that have been presented and to ask questions or talk through any points of discomfort, disagreement, or resistance. This may include fine-tuning language, discussing semantics, clarifying definitions, etc. until ultimately there is full consensus in the group. We elicit this information with the following prompt:

_What guidelines need to be amended? What do you not agree with?_

Consensus is not a democracy. In Circle, the majority is not what wins. Rather, we factor for the _lowest common denominator_. The goal is to cultivate an environment where everyone is simultaneously recognized individually and responded to collectively. In Circle there is no majority, there is simply everybody.

Everyone’s needs are part of the collective container. If any participant in the circle is expressing a need around safety, all participants choose to go to the _safest place_ with that person in such a way that they also maintain their own needs for safety. The desired outcome is a list of guidelines that have been carefully crafted and refined so that every word takes into account the needs of each person.&#x20;

Once completed, each participant should be able to look at the list and feel that they are both fully represented and able to honestly and confidently represent the needs of others. In order to get to this unanimous place, the group must share space until everyone reaches consensus. Although we seldom revisit the guidelines after this entire process, anyone in the circle can ask that we revisit the guidelines and makes amends at any time. Ensuring this permission maintains lasting consensus.&#x20;

#### Speak From Your Own Lived Experience (The Unwritten Element)

While the Five Constituent Elements make up the fundamental building blocks of Circle Process, we find that it is also helpful to discuss the “unwritten” element, which is to “speak from your own lived experience.”&#x20;

Circle creates an opportunity for people to do individual “work” with the support of community. As discussed in module two, the talking piece allows participants to take up the space they need to be seen and witnessed to experience the power of giving voice to their own shadow parts. This is not an opportunity for conversation or communication. We are specifically not interacting with the truth of others. We are simply playing a part in the inner transformation of another. As such, it can be very helpful to apply the understanding that, when speaking, we are taking the opportunity to share stories, wisdom, and lessons from our _own lives only_.

Not all groups desire this approach and, very often, this can feel deeply challenging and unnatural for people who are conditioned to take on the responsibility and emotional weight of other people’s experiences. However, we believe that intentionally creating a boundary around this part of the process contributes to the transformational power of Circle.&#x20;

We are holding space for a fundamentally different way of being in presence with others - one that eliminates the common experience of having to navigate the projective qualities of the outside world, providing the freedom to see ourselves and others in the truest form, and using the safety of the container to hold that truth in whatever form it needs to exist.\
