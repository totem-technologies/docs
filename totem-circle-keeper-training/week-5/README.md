# Week 5

### Preparing a Circle

#### Determine the Type/Purpose of Your Circle

* There are many different types of Circles to choose from. Circle Keepers can be creative with how or why they are bringing a community of people together. However, it is essential that you as the Keeper are rooted in your intention so that you can guide questions and energy appropriately.

#### Participants

* Once you've determined your topic you can begin to consider who you want your participants to be. Although you may be tempted to engineer the demographics of your Circle, we offer a gentle reminder that everyone who is supposed to participate will be there. who attends is exactly the right person. That being said, the clearer your intention/purpose, the more easily you will attract those who are meant to participate in this work.

#### Location (Online or In Person)

* Circles can be held in person or online. We are proud to offer the Totem app as a carefully crafted online platform for hosting Circle that protects what we value most about Circle Process. There are benefits to both online and in-person Circles. However, there will be different considerations for each. An in-person Circle will require more thought and emphasis on the environment, aesthetics, and physical space (as discussed in previous modules).

#### Time and Length

* You will need to determine the length of the Circle both in terms of the individual session and the number of weeks that members are invited to participate. Circles can be offered in a one-off or (closed group) ongoing format. Ongoing, closed group Circles require that the same participants attend a set number of sessions.
* Single-session Circles may have certain limitations regarding the depth that can be reached, however, the capacity for transformation is powerful in its own right. Single sessions can provide a valuable opportunity to bring people together to explore a variety of meaningful topics.
* In Circles where depth work is a priority, we highly recommend hosting a Circle for a minimum of six weeks. We have found that the ideal length is twelve weeks. Very often, there is a desire to continue beyond the six-week mark as people are eager for continued deepening once they have experienced what is possible within this uniquely crafted space.
* A Circle session goes by very quickly. Ninety minutes appears to be an effective amount of time for a group to have a balanced opportunity to speak and listen. A group of six or seven can easily fill up ninety minutes. We do not recommend less than ninety minutes unless you are in Circle with less than five people. Longer sessions with more people are possible with appropriate planning.

#### Co-Keeper

* Although it's not necessary to have a co-keeper we recommend utilizing this whenever possible. A co-keeping relationship can help to balance out the group and provide a valuable perspective on dynamics that may be showing up within the group.

#### Centerpiece

* We recommend a centerpiece whenever possible, although this is somewhat more challenging in an online group. A centerpiece is a symbol that creates a focal point onto which participants can direct their energy. This central point has sometimes been described as the “hub of a wheel” with each participant playing a vital role in balancing the rim while directing the “spokes” of their energy into the center. Likewise, the centerpiece can be appreciated as the “fire” that holds the energy of the group.
* Centerpieces can be as creative as you would like to make them but should be aesthetically pleasing and simple. It is important that it does not create a barrier between the group members (a table for example) that might prevent them from clearly seeing and experiencing one another.
* Cloth, flowers, stones, candles, etc. are all examples of possible elements of a centerpiece. It is common for members to contribute personal symbols to the center as a visual representation of the group's united energy.

#### Opening ceremony

* As discussed in previous modules the opening ceremony is an important part of setting the tone of the space. We've often found that members enjoy contributing to the ceremony. Opening activities can include breathing exercises, meditations, poems, stories, movement, etc. They should be in alignment with the larger purpose of the Circle. We encourage you to be creative in how you open your Circles.

### Prompts

#### Check-in

* Check-ins are an opportunity to get a sense of where participants are at as they enter the space. We have found that the question, _“what do you need to say to be present,”_ is a useful check-in that allows people to give a voice to whatever may be pulling at their attention at that moment. However, this is certainly not the only check in question that can be useful. Once again you can be creative with how you approach the check-in, understanding that the primary goal is to allow people to release whatever it is that may be drawing their attention or energy away from the Circle and/or preventing them from being fully present.

#### Designing Effective Questions (from Kay Pranis’ _Circle Keeper Handbook 2017_)

* The shape of the question has an enormous impact on the shape of responses. It is worth taking time to frame questions carefully. Effective questions are framed to
  * encourage participants to speak from their own lived experience (e.g. How have you been impacted? What has this situation been like for you? What has been the hardest thing for you? What do you need to move forward? What can you offer to help this situation?)
  * invite participants to share stories from their lives (Share an experience when you . . .)
  * focus on feelings and impacts rather than facts
  * invite recognition of strengths or assets as well as the difficulties
  * transition participants from the discussion of difficult or painful events into discussion of what can be done now to make things better.

#### Flow of Prompts

* While we want to bring the group to a place where they step into the topic that addresses inner, interpersonal, or systemic conflict, it is important that participants are led there in ways that also highlight the hopeful and resilient aspects of the human experience. We strongly recommend that you design your Circle so that the final round “brings the group back up” in a way that emphasizes hopeful forward-thinking energy. Do not leave the Circle in a space of heaviness.

#### Low-Stakes vs Deep-Dive Questions

* Prompts are a very important aspect of the Circle Process. As you familiarize yourself with Circle you will begin to feel how the careful phrasing of a question can open space for a wide variety of responses. A successful prompt will allow participants to determine their own level of depth. Therefore, open-ended questions are essential.
* Low-stakes prompts are those that are focusing more on surface level contributions. These are particularly important when you are dealing with a group of people that may struggle to find safety with one another. Low-stakes questions may elicit laughter or a lighthearted connection. They may provide an opportunity to contribute to a topic that is related to everyone in the group without requiring too much vulnerability. Depending on your demographics it may be helpful to incorporate some low-stakes prompts as a way to allow participants to adjust to the space and one another before diving into the more complex areas under the surface.
* If you observe that many people are passing or opting not to speak (as is often the case with children, young adults, or groups where there is underlying relational conflict or tension) this is an indication that the space may not yet feel entirely safe. While the process of values and guidelines is the most effective way to establish safety in a Circle, low-stakes questions may be an effective short-term solution to coax participants into a deeper understanding of the work they will be doing together.
  * Examples of Low-Stakes Prompts: \
    \- _What was your first car?_ \
    _- What makes you laugh?_ \
    _- Share a story of a proud moment in your work._
* Deep-Dive questions are those that encourage more vulnerability and depth. It is important to remember that “depth” varies from person to person - what may feel like a huge vulnerable risk to one person may feel “surface level” to another. This is where it becomes essential for a Circle Keeper to step back and allow the process to unfold for each person as it needs to.
  * Examples of Deep-Dive Prompts: \
    _- An experience of major change that you were unhappy about that turned out well for you. - What is your greatest fear in this relationship/situation?_ \
    _- Tell about a time when you had to make a really difficult decision that came from your heart._
* Our ultimate objective is to use carefully crafted questions to help participants speak whatever words they need to purge and with whatever shadow they need to pull from their soul in the safety and confidentiality of the circle. We hypothesize that if a question is effective enough, the person trying to answer it will encounter a transformation in the journey of searching for the answer.

#### Checkout

* Checkout is an opportunity for participants to summarize the wisdom gleaned from the Circle. A simple checkout question we recommend is, “what is a word or phrase that summarizes what you are leaving with.” Once again, there are many possibilities for how you can elicit this information from participants. The main goal is to provide a prompt that provides an opportunity to pull together the learning from the Circle.

#### Closing ceremony

* Like the opening ceremony, the closing ceremony closes the Circle and offers a ritual that allows participants to step out of the container feeling positive, supported, and reflective.

#### Personal practices to help ground and align yourself

* How you show up as a Circle Keeper matters. We encourage you to find practices that ground and support your energy so that you are able to show up in alignment with your intentions and in integrity with the process.

#### Things to consider

* How will people sign up?
* How much will you charge?
* How will you encourage and support regular attendance for ongoing Circles?
