### The Power of Listening

Listening is the most important work we do in the circle. This work is a yoga that makes us better and better at holding space for others. It has become clear to me that strengthening this skill makes us more useful; to all those in our lives. I hypothesize that if men are taught conscious listening and experience the power it affords them; then they will use it and be measurably more peaceful.&#x20;

During one of our Circle trainings, our teacher, who is my teacher Elizabeth’s teacher, Kay Pranis, told the following story which I believe illustrates this point. She ran a conflict/healing circle in a prison. A gang leader, doing a life sentence, was mandated to join this circle.  Although at first, he was reticent and disbelieving of any possible value to this format, after a few weeks of Circle, he told the following story (paraphrasing): Another inmate was screaming in my face this morning. Normally, I would have “ended him” for this disrespect but I realized he just had the talking piece at that moment. So, I let him finish his rant and saw that he just needed his turn to speak. Furthermore, normally five guards can’t keep me quiet, but this silly little talking piece absolutely commands my respect.&#x20;

Imagine a world in which people believe that listening is the most powerful contribution they can give. And, they are good at it. Imagine how this would fundamentally change the fabric of society. Imagine if we were promoted based on how well we listen rather than the content we deliver when we speak.&#x20;

I believe we are programmed to think that the way we penetrate the world is by allowing our ego to be clever, to leverage scarcity, and to imagine that our creations are the most important contribution we have. What if this programming isn’t serving us, anyone else, or the planet? I think this programming leaves us in a constant scarcity mindset of needing to bring the next best answer, solution, creation, invention, cure, etc. This is exhausting and leaves us feeling empty. It is a finite game where even those who win will ultimately feel a lack. All of it suggests that we are special and we need to use this unique nature to offer something the world has never seen before. What if this isn’t true or helpful? What if it would serve us far better to create something new only after we contributed with our listening?

### Listening To vs. Listening For

There are different kinds of listening. They may physically function the same way but their intent and effect are not the same.

When we listen _to_, we hold space for the words that are being sent toward us. When we listen _for_, we are looking for words that match our preconceptions.

When we listen _to_, we are willing to be surprised. When we listen _for_, we try to bring the communication to a conclusion.

We fully listen to a person speak when we allow ourselves to be empty containers. As an empty container, there is no space for our ego, only space for the words that are being shared with us.

The words are only containers for energy. Sharing your voice fills words with emotions. It uses intention to send those words.

When there is a container to hold these thoughts/feelings sent via intention, we create intimacy. Intimacy is sharing to be known and listening to know.

Sharing to be understood and listening for agreement builds skyscrapers, not intimacy.

Listening to and listening for are both essential. It empowers us to be conscious of the kind of listening we do.

When we listen unconsciously, we run the risk of using the wrong tool and hearing nothing.

### Equal vs Essential&#x20;

All voices are not equal, they are essential.&#x20;

We talk a lot about equal voices. I think we are not using the word that will serve this sentiment best. This deserves better language so that it might manifest.&#x20;

All voices are not equal.&#x20;

All voices are essential.&#x20;

All voices are all different and that is their greatest strength. To say they are all equal suggests that they all have the same value.&#x20;

I am not sure why we would assess the value of a voice. Maybe what we really want is to ensure everyone is heard.&#x20;

I believe that having the feeling of being heard is paramount. When people feel they are not heard, we all suffer. When any voice is not heard, we begin to rip our delicate, intertwined social fabric.

In the same way that harmony is created by playing different notes that resonate at the same time, different voices shared consciously create harmony.

Rather than fighting for equality, I wonder if we could focus our powerful attention on insisting all voices are heard. Rather than treating people equally, I wonder if we might listen for what people need and do everything in our power to give it to them.&#x20;

### On Finding the Right Questions

We use carefully crafted questions to help them into this abyss of silence. A silence they can either choose to simply be in or fill with whatever words they need to purge, with whatever sounds they need to utter in front of their tribe, with whatever shadow they need to pull from their soul in the safety and confidentiality of the circle.&#x20;

We hypothesize that if a question is effective enough, the person trying to answer it will encounter a transformation in the journey of searching for the answer. In addition, the answers that people give may offer those _listening_ to a special kind of insight into their own humanity. If this is true, then the questions we answer become the technology by which we operate. When questions lead us into the depth of our own souls, then a bond is created with those who hear our answers similar to the bond created by sharing an experience together.&#x20;

We are searching for the great questions which will allow us to delve deep into the psyches of men. The questions that will lead them to fight the internal dragon — the one that we don’t believe exists. I think we act badly primarily when we act unconsciously.  If we are in a battle with our own dragon then it is difficult to be unconscious. One moment of unconsciousness and its breath, our breath, can cook our insides.&#x20;

Our own personal dragon is everything we are afraid of and he is absolutely a large part of who we are. Facing it means admitting weakness. It means showing up vulnerable and knowing that only the truth will protect us from this amalgam of all of the terrors we could imagine: a large, powerful reptile that breathes fire and flies. Or, a perfect juxtaposition of all of our mammalian instinctual fears.

The right questions will lure the dragon out of its cave or maybe the right questions will give us the armor necessary to protect us from its powerful fire. It has the gold — insight. We want it. We must slay it to receive the lesson.&#x20;

What is the type of question we are looking for? It holds up a mirror.  It forces a reckoning with self to answer it. It immediately brings up deep-seated fear. It questions the program that we have been running. It illuminates a pathway toward truth. It allows us to tap into deep wisdom as we become a conduit rather than an ego. It might be a series of questions; a three-act structure that takes us on a journey through our own experience. Maybe the question seems inviting and then leads us into danger. Perhaps it asks us to be honest with ourselves in a way we have never been before. It is probably something we don’t want to answer in front of others and yet, by answering it in front of others, we will experience great catharsis. \
