# Totem Keeper Handbook

## Circle Creation <a href="#_a8oj7d7rqi84" id="_a8oj7d7rqi84"></a>

1. Sign in to [https://app.heytotem.com/](https://app.heytotem.com/) with a Keeper account. We recommend using the **Chrome** from Google for the best compatibility.
2. Click the Create Circle button (1). Note if you are not on a Keeper account, you will not see the button.
   1. You can also adjust your profile settings by clicking on the Profile button (2).
3.  On the create screen, fill out a circle name. Make it descriptive, so people joining can easily pick it out.

4.  Optionally, you may put in a description. This will show up on the next screen if you’d like to provide additional context to participants.

5. After selecting the Create Circle button, make sure you allow the browser permission to use your camera and microphone. On some systems you may need to change additional settings in the browser to ensure it functions properly (in Chrome: chrome://settings/content/camera?search=camera)
   1. Note: you cannot make changes to the microphone or camera devices once you select Join Circle. Make sure you have picked the devices you want to use before proceeding.
6. Next, you should see the Join Circle screen. Here you can adjust your audio and video settings. Make sure you can see yourself in the box to the left of the Join Circle button.
   1. If you can’t see yourself, click Audio and Video Settings to adjust which inputs to use.
   2.  Sometimes people will accidentally block access to their camera or microphone. In the URL bar they will see a red X over the camera or microphone icon.&#x20;

   3. To troubleshoot this, follow Google’s guide here: [https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2693767](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2693767)
7. When you see yourself and the correct microphone is selected, click Join Circle to enter the waiting room.
8.  This is the waiting room. This is where people will arrive before the circle starts. The Keeper of the circle has a Star icon next to their name.

9. To set the speaking order of the circle, click the Info icon at the bottom of the screen.
10. On the Info screen, you may rearrange the talking order, from top to bottom, by clicking and holding the 3 line icon on each row. While holding, drag the row to the order you’d like it. Press the X icon in the top corner to save and close your selection. On this screen you may also remove participants by clicking the trashcan icon.

11. When ready to start the circle, click the yellow Start button on the waiting room screen. Only the Keeper may start a circle.&#x20;
    1. **Note: New participants will not be able to join a circle after it has started.** However, people who were there when the circle started will be able to rejoin if they leave by accident.

## Circle Moderation <a href="#_vloj1qjpw9c1" id="_vloj1qjpw9c1"></a>

Once the circle has started, you’ll see the circle screen. Click Receive to pick up the totem and start speaking. To learn how to be a circle participant, refer to the **Totem Participant Handbook**. Here we’ll go over the moderation features that only Keepers have access to.

Please Note: by default, all participants who are not the active receiver will be muted. They may unmute themselves at any time, however. Each time a participant passes to the next person, all people who are not the receiver will be muted again.

At the bottom of your screen are the moderation tools. Some of these buttons are available to everyone (Mute, Video, Info (with limited functions) and Fullscreen), some are for Keepers only. Here we’ll only cover the Keeper-specific functions. See the Participant Handbook for the common features.

* **Up Next**: This skips the person who is currently speaking. This is useful if that person is away or is having technical issues. We do not recommend using this to skip people who are actively speaking.
* **Reverse**: This reverses the talking order. Some Keepers may opt to not use this, but it can be a nice way to change the pace of the circle.
* **Info**: This will open up a screen with extra functions. From this screen you can adjust the speaking order or remove people from the circle.
* **End Circle**: Use this when you want to end the circle and remove everyone from the space.
