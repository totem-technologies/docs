# Circle Keeper Training - Week 2

Although the five constituent elements of Circle Process can seem simplistic at first, there are layers of complexity that are taking place within the energetic exchanges of the container. As you sit in Circle you may begin to tap into the depth of this space and either see or feel the power of what is being exchanged. Although the true transformation happens experientially, there are some logistical and philosophical components of these elements that may support you in your learning. &#x20;

## The importance of Ceremony

### Power in Ceremony

Ceremony is an essential component of Circle. It can open a space of  non-ordinary reality. We might call this space sacred (i.e. pure or a complete relic). It can be a profound (i.e. from depth, bottomless) space. We enter into and exit out of it with intention. Intention is one of the essential ingredients of a this container. Intention combined with a talking piece radically shifts communication into dialogue (dia logos or sharing our meanings until they become one).

By observing religions (or nations states, organizations, etc.), it seems we thrive when a ritual (i.e. a formal or identifiable pattern, structure, format) is created. Although we often resist or disregard formalities. Formal simply means _to create form_.&#x20;

In Circle, the intention of ceremony is to create this form, this container.  This container allows us to engage in both intrapersonal and interpersonal work. A powerful ceremony can point us, together, toward transcendence (i.e. to move beyond physical or Newtonian reality).

To illustrate, imagine a group of paperclips spread out on a glass table with the goal of getting them to point in the same direction (like sharing an intention). A Newtonian approach would be to use time and effort and turn every individual paperclip. A Quantum approach would be to hold a magnet at the end of the table. The magnetic field turns all the clips to point at the magnet simultaneously. We might think of the participants in Circle as paperclips and the field created through a shared intention held in place by the ceremony.

### Ceremony vs Conversation

Another important function of ceremony in Circle is to create a distinct difference between our unconscious patterns and Circle process. The ceremony of Circle indicates that we are entering into a space to do intentional work together and not to have a conversation, not to hang out or catch up. In a “conversation,” we are interacting with one another in a vastly different way. We nod and agree, go back and forth, and may not see or hear each other.

Conversation usually does not include an agreement about what the exchange is meant to accomplish, a clear sense of when or how it ends, or what the rules are for ending it. There is nothing to distinguish between when one person has stopped speaking and when another person begins. In the “game” of conversation, one person stops speaking and another person might feel an obligation to respond immediately after to avoid seeming rude, impolite, or awkward.&#x20;

To tolerate silence in conversation, we might need to create intimacy (In To Me See). It is often said “people don’t want to listen”. Maybe the problem isn’t a lack of interest in listening but an expectation to speak when the other person stops speaking. This might be amplified by a pressure to respond with something meaningful.

We often prepare what we will say while the other person is speaking. Maybe this is actually prosocial with an intention to play the conversation game in such a way that everyone enjoys it.&#x20;

Circle is an entirely different game. A Circle has a clear intention, and participants understand why they are meeting. There are guidelines and agreements in place to ensure that each participant feels safe and can do the work they want to do. Often, we meet for a prescribed period of time, over a prescribed period of weeks.

Once these elements are established, nodding our heads to show agreement becomes unnecessary, irrelevant and counter-productive. Maybe we nod our head or agree because we need to not to support the other person. Maybe we want to show that we are doing it “right.” In Circle we release the social expectation of doing it “right.”

In the ceremony of Circle, participants are expected to be present and to listen from the heart. When we play _that_ game, true transformation can occur.

### The Importance of the Talking Piece&#x20;

#### Three Rules of the Talking Piece

1. There is a Talking Piece. Or, in the digital space, we act as if.&#x20;
2. The talking piece only goes in one direction. That does not mean that everybody is equal, but everybody is essential. Each voice must have an opportunity to share.&#x20;
3. You are always allowed to pass (take the talking piece and give the talking piece to the next person without saying anything). Circle is one of the few arenas in the world where silence can be heard. Few people pass but maybe that is because having permission to pass is all they need to feel safe or brave enough to speak.&#x20;

#### Why the Talking Piece Matters

Holding the talking piece gives people permission to speak their truth, without an expectation of being interesting nor performing. It is simply _sharing to be known_. The talking piece ensures that the holder is not interrupted but instead heard, seen and witnessed.

The talking piece does not amplify speech like a microphone. Instead everyone else is silent so that the holder can be heard at the volume which the speaker chooses to share. Sometimes a whisper, sometimes punctuated by silences. After every story has been spoken out loud without interruption, everyone’s stories can be woven together into one logos.&#x20;

The talking piece gives each participant the opportunity to take up whatever space they choose to do their individual work at their highest possible level within the community, without interruption.

### The Role of the Circle Keeper

_Ted talks about this_ [_here!_](https://www.veed.io/view/05a192f6-fd1b-4657-9456-d4a326059460?panel=share)__

At Totem, we believe that an effective Circle Keeper strives toward the following qualities:

* **Curiosity** - A great Keeper walks two steps behind and maintains an attitude of openness to whatever arises.&#x20;
* **Attuned** - A great Keeper has the willingness and ability to “read the field,” tuning into the seen and unseen dynamics that are taking place within the group and within themselves.&#x20;
* **Sovereign and integrated** - A great Keeper knows that they are simultaneously separate from and integrated into the collective. They recognize the duality that is inherent in this space and the need to be both a part of and apart from the experience.&#x20;
* **Intentional** - A great Keeper is intentional about who they are in the space, what they are doing, and why they are doing it.&#x20;
* **Aligned** - A great Keeper is aware of and connected to the truth within themselves and makes every effort to speak and hold space from that part of themselves.
* **Patient**  - A great Keeper will trust the process and recognize that the experience unfolds exactly as it should, within its own time and in its own way.

As a TCK, you have an outstanding effect on every participant in the Circle. People will naturally look at you to determine the rules of the social structure because that is the nature of what humans do in a space where there is a leader. Although the Circle Keeper is not the leader, they are the person with the most experience and therefore hold a responsibility that is separate and different from everyone else's responsibility.

Many humans live with a deep-seated need to “fix” and “solve” problems in their lives and in the lives of others. It is important that Circle Keepers recognize this tendency in themselves and actively step away from this mentality, even if the ego would suggest otherwise. This is not your role. In fact, by taking on the role of problem solver, you derail the energetic process of what is taking form within the space. With experience, you will come to realize you are not serving the group by trying to fix anything. As Circle Keeper, your only agenda is to hold the Circle and allow the wisdom of the Circle to find its balance.

Therefore, we encourage you to notice and be aware of your verbal and non-verbal communication, and to be intentional about how and why you are engaging in the way that you are. Self-awareness is a tool that will make you a more powerful Keeper. With intention, you will be more present and aware of how you're _being_ and how you're _showing up_.

The mission of the Circle Keeper is to support the process of building the foundation Circle and holding the structure - not to be distracted by the content of what is coming at them from within. Instead, a Keeper frames that which is being voiced within and allows the work of the Circle to find its way. The Circle itself has wisdom, and the wisdom will find its way through the voices of the people in the space.

Each person has a unique perspective on the world. When we allow for the opportunity to hear the various perspectives that exist within a Circle, we start to formulate a more holistic map. When a group of people lands into some kind of heart coherence or heart frequency, they start to open up a _portal_, ultimately accessing a channel that is not exactly _them_. Some people call that God, some people call it the Quantum Field, and some people call it Spirit (a term often used when taught by either indigenous teachers or shamanic teachers). Whatever you prefer to name it, that energy begins to speak through the collective.

We encourage you to embody the understanding that when you're the Circle Keeper, you are neither running the Circle, mediating the Circle, nor managing the Circle. You are not facilitating or leading any of those things. Those forces are working beyond you. You are simply keeping the Circle.

### Talking Order

Choosing the talking order is the Circle Keeper’s job. We recommend that the Circle Keeper or Co-Keeper go first as a way to model how to answer the prompt and to set the tone for the group. In any group process, members are taking cues from others as a way to guide them into a deeper understanding of the space, so that they can understand where they fit and how to “behave.” By starting the process, answering the prompt, speaking from the heart, and sharing openly, members will begin to experiment with stepping into this space little by little until they know that they are safe to be themselves.&#x20;
