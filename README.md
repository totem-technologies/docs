# Totem Participant Handbook

## Account Creation <a href="#_1n2z1stkwgdw" id="_1n2z1stkwgdw"></a>

This section will describe in greater detail how to make a Totem account. Ideally you can skip this section because we try to make the account creation process as easy as possible.

## Joining a Circle <a href="#_ld1pco4pymu" id="_ld1pco4pymu"></a>

![](.gitbook/assets/5)

1. To join a circle, go to [https://app.heytotem.com/](https://app.heytotem.com/) in a Chrome browser.
2. Find the circle in the list of circles that you want to join and click it.

![](<.gitbook/assets/6 (1)>)

1. On the Join Circle screen, check that your video, speakers and microphone are working correctly. Click “Audio and Video Settings” to adjust these settings.
2. Make sure you allow the browser permission to use your camera and microphone. On some systems you may need to change additional settings in the browser to ensure it functions properly (in Chrome: chrome://settings/content/camera?search=camera)
   1. Note: you cannot make changes to the microphone or camera devices once you select Join Circle. Make sure you have picked the devices you want to use before proceeding.
3. When satisfied, click Join Circle to enter the circle waiting room.

1. Done! This is the circle waiting room. Here the Keeper (the name with the Star icon) will take over and start the circle when everyone is ready. If you need to leave, you can press the X icon in the top right corner.

## Being in Circle <a href="#_cya9hxyauk26" id="_cya9hxyauk26"></a>

Once the Keeper starts the circle, you’ll be transported into the circle screen (above). While in circle, the app will cycle through each participant as they receive or pass the totem. There are two main screens, the listener view and the speaker view.

The **listener view** (shown above) is what people without the totem see, the people who are listening. The center will show the person who has the **totem** and is speaking. The right side will show everyone who is listening. Whoever is next will have the Up Next label over their video.

To help everyone have the best experience possible, everyone who does not have the totem will be put on mute. Each time the totem passes to the next person, everyone without the totem will be muted again.

The **speaker view** is what the person who has the totem sees. The people listening will be in the center of the screen. **The person speaking will not be able to see themselves**. **** This can cause some confusion at first, but it helps people not worry about how they look, so they will be able to share more authentically. When they are finished sharing they press the Pass button to pass the totem to the next person.

This is the Receive screen. When it is your turn, you will see this screen to accept the totem and start your turn. Make sure your camera is working, and you are in frame because you will not be able to see yourself after you accept the totem. When you are done speaking you can press the Pass button (shown in the speaker view) to pass the totem to the next person.
